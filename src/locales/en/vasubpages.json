      "description": "Massage is a general term to describe the manual manipulation of muscles, tendons and ligaments for therapeutic effect. Massage is often directed to treat both acute and chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, knee pain, osteoarthritis, neck and shoulder pain, and migraines. It is also useful for recovery from activity or injury, PTSD, and neurological conditions such as fibromyalgia. A study by the National Institute of Health (NIH) Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine found a single massage can effectively decrease levels of cortisol (the stress hormone), boost white blood cell levels, and improve levels of oxytocin, a hormone that improves mood and reduces stress."
